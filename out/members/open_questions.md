## New model fields not derivable from mirror alone
- Authentication identifiers / emails: mirrored pages may include emails, but we are not outputting them by default.
- Privacy levels / field visibility rules: need modernization docs.
- Roles/permissions model: we infer activity roles (Contact) but cannot map to final role enums without docs.
